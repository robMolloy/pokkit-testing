Rules for Test Case Naming

- Start with the expected outcome: allow or deny.
- Follow with the operation under test: a short verb or verb phrase.
- Use a colon : to separate the operation from the specific scenario.
- Describe the scenario in natural language (user state, permissions, input data, etc.).
- If multiple test cases are included in a single name, separate them with a semicolon ;.
- Optional: Use consistent tense and phrasing in the scenario description for readability.
