# Test Suite Todos

## User Authentication & Authorization

- replace current test files
  - test each rule systematically, i.e. list, view create, update, delete
  - don't worry about verbosity
- add user create rules that only allow relevant login types
  - i.e. turn off authWithPassword, check it fails then reverse
- use the pocketbase dashboard to further improve the auth test suite based on the api preview
